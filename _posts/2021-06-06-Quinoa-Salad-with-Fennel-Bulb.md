### Method:

__*Making the Quinoa*__

Rinse the uncooked quinoa until water runs clear; drain the water. Turn on the stovetop to med-high temperature. Heat a pot, and make sure you use one with a lid. Once hot, add oil. Once the pot and oil are hot, add quinoa, turmeric, thyme, salt, pepper, and water and cover. Bring to boil. Once boiled, lower the temperature to simmer and cook the quinoa for 15 minutes. When finished, separate the quinoa using a fork, put it in a big bowl and set it aside to cool down.

### Making the Salad
Place the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Slice the fennel bulb into cubes, put it in a separate bowl and add some dressing just enough to coat it. Put it aside to marinate just until everything is all chop and ready.
