__*The Crust*__

Put all the crust ingredients into the food processor and run until the texture looks doughy, about 1 min run time. When done, transfer it to a 9-inch baking dish lined with parchment paper. Spread the mixture evenly and press it down at the bottom of the dish evenly to form the pie dish shape. Cut around the parchment for a clean look. Place it aside while we prepare the filling.

__*The Filling*__

To make the pie filling, put all the filling ingredients into the blender. Run the blender until the texture is smooth and Pour it into the prepared pie dish.

We bake it for 35 mins or until the pumpkin is golden brown. If the middle is still soft, it’s okay as it gets hardened as cools down. Once cooled down, the pie is ready. You can serve it as-is or with ice cream.


Happy cooking!
