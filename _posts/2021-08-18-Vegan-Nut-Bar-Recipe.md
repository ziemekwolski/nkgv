Do you ever wish that you had a handy vegan snack that was easy to grab and eat? What if I told you that it was easy to make and requires only a few minutes to complete? This vegan nut bar is for you!

## Ingredients:
* 2 1/2 cup mixed nuts
* 1/4 cup dried goji berries
* 1/2 cup pitted dates
* 1 1/2 Tbsp. agave syrup
* 1/2 tsp. molasses
* 1/2 Tbsp. lemon juice
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 2 pinches ground sea salt
* 2 pinches ground nutmeg
* 1 Tbsp. ground chia (black or white)
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

Warning, this nut bar is hard to resist! You might want to double the recipe. I always do for a family of 4, and it only lasts us for a few days.

## Method:

__*Mixture*__

![Ingredients](/assets/images/posts/2021-08-18-vegan-nut-bar-recipe/ingredients.jpg "Ingredients")

Preheat oven to 325 °F.
In this recipe, I mixed equal parts of pecan, cashew and walnuts, unsalted. In a food processor, put the mixed nuts, dried goji berries and pitted dates and run it for about 20 seconds or until coarsely ground. Add agave syrup, molasses, lemon juice and vanilla. Put the lid on and run again for another 5 seconds. Lastly, add sea salt, nutmeg, baking soda and ground chia (your choice of black or white), run it for another 14 seconds until texture holds together when pinched.

Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a spatula, flatten the mixture and formed an even square until you reach 1/4 inch of thickness. Make sure it is pressed down well enough for it not to come apart. Make a pre-squared line using your spatula for easy slicing later.

__*Baking*__

For baking, you have two options, an air fryer or a conventional oven. For the oven, I cook it for 15 minutes at 325 °F or until the top is golden brown. When using an air fryer, set it to 325 °F, but only bake for 12 minutes or when the top is golden brown. Once done, take it out from the oven and cool it down for about 10-15 minutes. Slice it into 12 evenly squares, and tada, your delicious nut bar is now ready to serve. Leftover can be stored in a tight lid jar at room temperature for at least a week.
