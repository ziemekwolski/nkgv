Eggplant Steak

One of my favourite vegetables is eggplant! Since now is the perfect season, I decided to re-create my version of Gordon Ramsey's recipe. I think it's much better. I would suggest that you cook it and decide for yourself!

## Ingredients:
* 1 Aubergine eggplant

### Marinade:
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 tsp caraway seeds, ground

### Filling
* Grapeseed oil
* 4 cups chopped cauliflower (470g)
* 3 cup chop oyster mushroom
* 1/2 cup onion
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 sprig fresh thyme or 1/2 tsp dried
* 1 red chilli, sliced thinly
* 1/4 cup chop parsley or cilantro
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, ground
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbsp Nutritional yeast
* 1/2 cup water
* Sea salt and pepper

## Method:


__*Preparing the Eggplant and Marinade*__

Slice the eggplant vertically, about 1/4 inch thick. Lay it flat and sprinkle with salt on both sides. Let it stand for 20 minutes. While waiting for 20 minutes, I make the marinade by adding balsamic, olive oil, and caraway seeds into a small bowl and mix.

Back to the eggplant, after 20 minutes, pat the water out from the eggplant on both sides using a paper towel. Brush both sides with marinade and let it sit for another 15 minutes. Prepare and chop the rest of the ingredients for the filling. When you are done chopping the filling vegetables, your marinated eggplant should be ready to fry.

__*Frying the Eggplant*__

Place a frying pan at medium heat on the stovetop. Once the pan is hot, add oil and let it sit for a little bit. Place each eggplant in the frying pan one at a time, for at least 2 minutes on each side. Keep a careful watch on the eggplant to avoid burning it. Once done, put the eggplant on a paper towel to remove that excess oil. Repeat the frying process until all the eggplants are cooked.

__*Cooking the filling*__

Put a saucepan on the stove and warm it up to medium heat. Once ready, add grapeseed oil, warm it up. Add onion, saute it for at least 1 minute before adding garlic and thyme. Cook until the onion becomes translucent before adding the chopped mushroom and season it with sea salt and pepper. Cook the mushroom for 10 minutes, mixing halfway through the process. After 10 minutes, add the cauliflower, tomato paste, smoked paprika, Worcestershire sauce, caraway seeds and water. Mix and cook for 7 minutes. Once complete, add the sliced red chillies, nutritional yeast and chopped parsley. You can adjust the salt and pepper according to your liking. Now the filling is done!

__*Plating*__

Take an eggplant and put the filling on top. Add my homemade mushroom gravy as garnish. I usually served this with some steamed greens, rice or mashed sweet potato.

Invite some friends over and enjoy your mouthwatering eggplant steak with the company of your friends and family.
