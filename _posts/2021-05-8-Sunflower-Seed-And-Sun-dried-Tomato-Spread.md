## Ingredients:
* 1 cup unshelled sunflower seeds
* 1 cup sun-dried tomato
* 3 tbsp. onion
* 1 clove garlic
* 1 tbsp. coconut sugar
* 1 tbsp. flax seed oil

## Method:
Rinse the sunflower seeds until the water runs clear. Soak the rinse sunflower seeds with water for at least an hour or overnight. After soaking, remove the water from the sunflower seeds and give it a quick rinse and drain it using the strainer. In the food processor, first put the sun-dried tomato and pulse for about 10 seconds. Add the sunflower seeds, onion and garlic and rerun it until coarsely chopped, scraping the side of the bowl in between. Once coarsely chop, add the coconut sugar and flax seed oil, then rerun it until well blended. Now your spread is ready!

To serve, we use toasted grain bread drizzled with aged balsamic vinegar before putting the spread, topped with ripe tomato and seasoned with salt and pepper on top to finish.
To serve as an appetizer, I use crackers topped with sliced grape tomato or sliced pickles. Enjoy!
