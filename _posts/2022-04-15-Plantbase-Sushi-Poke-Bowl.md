Serving a large variety of nutritious food to your family is often complicated and time-consuming; this recipe changes everything. Grab all the ingredients into a bowl, put some sauce on it, mix it and done! Poke bowls are lovely and easy to make.

I have shifted my family's meals to fun poke bowl ideas. I have to say it is deliciously wholesome. My family's love of sushi inspires this poke bowl recipe.

### Make-ahead suggestions:
- marinating the tofu
- making the sauce
- tofu coating mix

## Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup cooked short-grain brown rice
* 1/2 tsp vegan Furikake
* 1 tsp sushi seasoning
* Half sheet nori
* 3 strips of crispy tofu
* 7-10 homemade Japanese sweet potato chips
* 1/2 cup cubed ripe avocado
* 7-10 bell pepper thin slices
* 3/4 cup mix of pea shoots, purple cabbage, carrots and cucumber
* Salt & pepper
* Roasted sesame seeds for sprinkle

## Creamy Miso Sauce
* 1 1/2 tbsp low salt miso paste
* 1/3 cup vegan mayo
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 2 1/2 tbsp water

## Crispy Tofu Breading Mix
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
* 1/2 tsp granulated garlic powder
* 2 tbsp potato starch
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* Ground pepper

## Tofu Marinade
* 1 block of extra firm tofu
* 1 1/2 tbsp tamari gluten-free soya sauce
* 1 tbsp apple cider
* 1 tsp water


## Method

__*The Tofu*__

![Tofu](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-15-plantbase-sushi-poke-bowl/tofu.jpg "Tofu")

Rinse one block of extra firm tofu. Pat to dry, slice into half about half an inch thick, then cut into thin strips like french fries. Put the tofu into a tight lid container enough to fit them.

In a separate bowl, mix all the liquid marinade ingredients for the tofu and pour it over the tofu. Close the lid and shake the container making sure that the marinade covers all over the tofu. Leave the tofu to marinate overnight in the fridge.

__*The Breading*__

Combine all the tofu breading mix ingredients. Use the marinated tofu and individually coat it with the dry mix. At this point, you have two options; you can either bake or fry the tofu.

When baking, lay the coated tofu strip in a cookie tray and bake it at 375Â°F for 7 minutes on each side or until crispy brown.

When frying, to avoid using too much oil, use cast iron or a non-stick frying pan. Heat the pan on medium heat to cook the tofu. It should take about 2 minutes on each side or until crispy brown. I only use four tofu strips for a single serving and put the rest in the fridge for the next day's meal.

__*The Japanese sweet*__

![Potatoes](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-15-plantbase-sushi-poke-bowl/potatoes.jpg "Potatoes")

To make the Japanese sweet potato chips. Peel 1 or 2 Japanese sweet potatoes, slice them thinly like chips and put them in a bowl. Sprinkle it with 1/2 a teaspoon grapeseed oil and sea salt to your liking and mix. In medium heat, warm up the seasoned cast iron pan on the stovetop and fry the potato for about 2 minutes on each side. When frying the sweet potatoes, remember to avoid crowding them. If the potatoes are starting to burn, the temperature on the pan might be too hot. Adjust the stovetop heat temperature and increase the cooking time. Once finished, place aside when done.

__*The Sauce*__

Mix the miso paste with water to make the sauce until it thins out. Next, add the mayo and lemon. Vigorously mix all the ingredients until you reach the runny sauce texture. Put it aside.

__*The Vegetables*__

![Veggies](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-15-plantbase-sushi-poke-bowl/veggies.jpg "Veggies")

To prepare the fresh vegetable, cut them into small sizes. You can have fun and be creative while slicing the vegetable as long as it's bite-size. I mix the julienne carrots and cabbage with sliced cucumber and pea shoots. I like to prepare my vegetable slices enough for two days leftover and just put them in a tight lid container in the fridge. Once done slicing all the fresh vegetables, you can now season your cooked short grain brown rice with one teaspoon of [sushi seasoning](https://youtu.be/WPImIOsxMBA?t=90) and mix. Sprinkle it with [vegan furikake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SuWvse9UQU).

__*Plating*__

Now the fun begins! It's time to arrange the layered goodness into a bowl. Start by putting the seasoned rice at the bottom of the plate. On the top are nicely placed cooked tofu strips, potato slices, bell pepper, green lettuce, avocado, small cut-ups of nori, cucumber, purple cabbage, carrots, and pea shoots. Pour the sauce over the bowl and finish it by sprinkling white toasted sesame seeds.

You can now serve your delicious and colourful poke bowl. Enjoy!
