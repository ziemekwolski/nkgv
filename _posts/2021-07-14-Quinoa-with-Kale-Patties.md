These patties are always made in our kitchen during the garden season because we always plant plenty of kale. Not only do we enjoy harvesting our kale, but we also enjoy various recipes with it. This Quinoa and Kale patties are one of our top choices. Now I'm hungry, so let's get cooking.

### Method:

__*Cooking the quinoa*__

Let's begin with cooking the quinoa. Rinse the quinoa until water runs clear the drain. At medium temperature, heat the pot on a stovetop, add the clean and drained quinoa, add thyme, turmeric, sea salt, pepper and water. Cover the pot, turn the stovetop temperature to high and bring it to boil. Once boiling, lower the temperature to simmer and cook the quinoa for 15 minutes. Once done, separate the cooked quinoa using a fork, transfer it to a salad bowl to cool it down.

__*Creating the patty mixture*__

To the bowl with cool down quinoa, add chop kale, 1/4 cup chop parsley, 3 tbsp chives, 2 tbsp chop dill, 3 cloves chop garlic, 1/2 tsp grounded caraway seeds, 2 tbsp nutritional yeast, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup gluten-free flour, sea salt and pepper and mix until evenly combined. In a small bowl, add 3 tbsp of arrowroot starch, 3 tbsp grapeseed oil and 3/4 cup of water; mix and add to the quinoa bowl mixture. Mix again until well combined.

Turn on the stovetop to medium and heat the frying pan. Once heated, add a little bit of oil and put a quinoa patty. You can form all your patties ahead of time, or you can create it as you go, just like I did. Fry each side until golden brown. Repeat the process until the mixture is all done. Don't forget to put a paper towel underneath the cooked patties to remove the extra oil.

__*Making the sauce*__

Into a blender, add 1/2 cup parsley, 6 leaves of fresh mint, 1 tbsp dill, 1 clove of garlic, 2 tbsp mirin, 3 tbsp vegan mayonnaise, salt and pepper and 3 tbsp water. Blend until you get a saucy consistency. It should be about 10-20 seconds.
