Hi wonderful friends! Here comes another poke bowl recipe that I came up with. I love this recipe because of the barbecue turnip, which I hardly ever explored adding to my daily diet, but not anymore!
Another satisfying crunch addition to this poke bowl is the [pickled daikon and red radish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3D3Wq2oslg), and they are so easy to make too! Before I get started, keep in mind the measurement of the ingredients written is more than the amount of a single serving. Please adjust according to your need. When we are in a rush, the leftover is always great in our family. I like to store them in an individual container for a healthy quick-fix meal the following day or two.

## Ingredients:
* For the Barbecue Turnip:
* 2 Turnip Bulb
* 1 tsp grapeseed oil
* 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp granulated garlic
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp cayenne powder (optional)
* 2 Tbsp Nutritional Yeast
* Salt and Pepper

## For the Sauce
* 6 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds
* 2 Tbsp gluten-free Tamari soya sauce
* 1 1/2 Tbsp Agave syrup
* 2 Tbsp apple cider
* 1 tbsp vegan mayonnaise
* 1/4 water

* For poke bowl filler variation:
* 1/2 cup cooked white or red quinoa
* 1/4 cup sautéed button mushroom
* 1/4 cup cooked barbecue turnip
* 1/4 cup of steamed broccoli and edamame
* 1/4 cup of mixed julienne carrots, alfalfa micro-green and radicchio
* Few strips of pickled daikon and red radish
* 1/4 cup roasted sesame sauce

## Method

__*The Turnip*__

![Turnip](/assets/images/posts/2022-05-12-vegan-poke-bowl-with-barbecue-turnip/turnip.jpg "Turnip")

Warm up the oven to 375F.
While the oven is warming, start peeling and slicing the turnip into bite-size cubes. Season it with all the above list of turnip ingredients and mix it into a bowl. Layer it evenly onto a cookie tray.
Bake for 25-30 mins, mixing in about halfway through the process. It's done when the turnip is dry and crunchy to the touch.
I like [cooking the quinoa](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QZNwJxjEidE) while I'm baking the turnip.

__*The Mushrooms*__

I like to cook 2-3 cups of mushrooms, your choice of a white or brown button mushroom. Slice into 4. On a stovetop, warm up the pan and sauté the mushroom into medium heat until all the liquid evaporates. Set aside.

__*The Broccoli and Edamame*__

Next, I steam broccoli and edamame seeds in medium heat for 3 minutes in a separate pot. After 3 minutes, make sure to remove the pot's lid while removing it from the hot stovetop to avoid overcooking it.

__*The Mixed Greens*__

After that, in a separate bowl, I mix julienne carrots, alfalfa microgreen and thin slices of radicchio.

__*The Roasted Sesame Sauce*__

Preparing the roasted sesame sauce. Put all the sesame sauce ingredients into a blender and run it on high speed for about 30 seconds or until you get the smooth sauce texture. Measurement of the sauce ingredients is enough for two servings, so adjust accordingly. You can store any leftovers in a tight lid sauce jar. When using the leftover sauce, make sure to give it a good shake before serving.

Now that everything is cooked and prepared, you can start layering your bowl with all your wholesome ingredients. I like to start with a quinoa bed and then a variation of poke bowl filler on the list above. I top it with the sesame sauce.
