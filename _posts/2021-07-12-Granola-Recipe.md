Is your blood sugar level crashing at 3 pm? Do you have low iron? Having granola cereal in the morning is a quick and easy way to prevent both of these. The high amounts of iron in oats help your body quickly recover from iron deficiency, while the complex carbohydrates help to keep your blood sugar in check!

Try this super easy recipe that's sure to delight anyone. You can use it as a parfait topping, smoothie topping, with milk or just plain. Now let's get to it!

## Ingredients:

### Dry
* 4 cups rolled oats
* 1/2 cup flax seed
* 1 1/2 cups pecan nuts
* 1 cup cashew nuts
* 1 cup dried blueberries
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp. coconut sugar

### Wet
* 6 tbsp. agave syrup (divided into half)
* 1 tbsp. grapeseed oil
* 1 tsp. vanilla

## Instructions:

Turn the oven on for 250Â°F.

Into a bowl, mix rolled oats, flax seeds, pecan nuts, cashew nuts, cinnamon, salt, and put aside. In a small separate bowl, mix 3 tbsp of agave syrup, oil and vanilla, mix well and pour it into the oat bowl mixture. Mix until the agave mixture is well incorporated. Put in a cookie sheet tray, spread evenly, put in the middle rack of the oven, bake for 40 minutes, mixing halfway thru. After 40 minutes of baking, remove from the oven and cool down for 5 minutes.

After cooling down, add the dried blueberries and raisins and mix. Then add the remaining 3 tbsp of agave syrup, mix until well incorporated. Finally, dust it with 1 tsp of coconut sugar and mix. You can now enjoy your granola, from my kitchen to yours!
