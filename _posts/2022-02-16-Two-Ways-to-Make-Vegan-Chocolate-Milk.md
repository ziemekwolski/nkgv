I have created this milk chocolate recipe for the hot or cold seasons. It's thick and creamy for cold weather, but you can also use the smooth and light version for the summer months. The cashew milk gives it that thickness that the whole cream milk does. I always make my vanilla cashew milk myself but feel free to buy a pre-made one. The measurement of this recipe is suitable for one person. Don't worry about the leftover cashew milk. You can always put it in a glass jar and into the fridge to enjoy later. Don't forget to shake it before serving as cashew particles tend to settle at the bottom of the jar. You can store cashew milk in the refrigerator for up to three days. Now let's get started with the process.

## Ingredients:

### Cashew Milk

* 1 cup soaked cashew
* 2 tbsp agave syrup
* 4 cups of water
* 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract
* Pinch of salt

### Chocolate Milk

* 1 cup vanilla cashew milk
* 10g 100% Cacao tablet or 2 tbsp unsweetened cacao powder
* 1 tbsp brown granulated sugar or agave syrup
* 1/4 vanilla extract
* Pinch of salt

## Method:

Soak the cashew with water overnight or 5-8 hrs during the day. Soaking the cashew makes the milk creamy. Rinse the soaked cashew and put it in a high-powered blender with water, agave, salt, and vanilla. Run the blender to the highest setting for one and a half minutes or until the texture is smooth. I use a high-powered blender but run it longer until it's smooth if you have the regular blender. If you use plain cashew milk, adjust your vanilla extract from the original recipe to 1/2 tsp.

### Cold version

To make the cold version of the chocolate milk recipe, I add 1 cup of cashew milk and 10g of chop 100% cacao tablet to a blender. If you don't have the tablet, use 2 tbsp of cacao powder. Finally, add vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. You can adjust the measurement accordingly if you want more. Blend until smooth. Usually, this takes around one minute.


### Hot version

To make the hot and creamy version. Chop the 100% cacao table into a small piece, place it into a bowl and mix it with a pinch of salt. Mixing chop cacao with salt helps the cacao melt faster. Into a pot, put 1 cup of vanilla cashew milk. Turn the heat to medium temperature. Constantly whisk the cashew milk in the pot to avoid sticking to the bottom. Don't bring the cashew to boil completely. When you notice the steam from the milk, add the cacao and salt mixture together with vanilla extract right away. Keep whisking it for at least 5-6 minutes or until it becomes slightly thick. Transfer it to a mug and top it with marshmallows and dust of cacao for a beautiful finish. Hot chocolate is best to consume right away as it gets thicker the longer it sits.
