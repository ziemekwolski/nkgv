This recipe is creamy and satisfying to the palette. It reminds me of a recipe called Laing that I used to eat growing up, except we used taro leaves which are uncommon in Canada, so use spinach instead. You can use any type of spinach you have available. This dish goes well with brown rice or quinoa rice in our family. Now letâ€™s get to it.

## Ingredients:
* 500-600 grams spinach chopped
* 1 cup Coconut milk
* 1 cup coconut cream
* 1 knob ginger, thinly sliced
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1/2 big onion, chopped
* 1 vegetable cube
* 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, ground
* 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 175g bbq flavoured tofu bites
* Sea salt & pepper

## Method:

Chop the spinach into 1 inch roughly. In a wok, put the coconut milk, chop onion, garlic and vegetable cube. Bring to boil, make sure the vegetable broth dissolves well to avoid any clumps. Add chop callaloo spinach, caraway seeds, sea salt and pepper. Do not over-mixed the spinach. Gently fold it until it is evenly wilted and cook it for 10 minutes. Slice the tofu bites and add to the mix together with the coconut cream and mix gently. Cook for another 5 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, you can adjust the taste if needed. When done, evenly add the apple cider vinegar (you can use the regular vinegar), mix gently and serve.
