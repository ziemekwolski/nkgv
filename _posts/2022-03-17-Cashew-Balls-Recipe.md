Oh, my Cashew! That one type of nut that we like to get our omega-three from. A store-bought cashew ball was the inspiration for this recipe. I often buy them as a  special treat. The first time I made it, I brought it to my big extended family, and my sister-in-law immediately asked for the recipe. She said that she enjoyed the crunchy texture of the ball. That enjoyable crunch keeps you wanting more, so watch out! I often have this snack in a closed jar for my family to enjoy. I hope you enjoy it too! Now let's get started.

## Ingredients:
* 2 cups roasted cashew
* 1/2 cup unsweetened desiccated coconut (divided)
* 1/2 cup quinoa puff
* 1 cup brown or white rice Krispies cereal
* 6 pcs or 1/2 cup pitted dates
* 1 tbsp agave
* 3 tbsp brown rice syrup
* 2 tbsp ground flax
* 2 pinch ground sea salt

### Method
Take 1/4 cup of desiccated coconut and roast it on the stove for high-medium heat using a pan. Roast it, constantly mixing until you get the golden brown color. Put aside to cool down.

In a food processor, put 2 cups of roasted cashew and six pieces big or eight pieces small pitted dates,  close the food processor and run for 35 seconds or until it's coarsely ground.

After 35 seconds, add 1/4 cup unsweetened desiccated coconut, 2 tbsp ground flax, two pinches of ground sea salt, 1/2 cup quinoa puff or roasted quinoa and 1 cup Rice Krispies cereal. Add 1 tbsp agave syrup or maple syrup and 3 tbsp of brown rice syrup. The last two ingredients are essential, and it is vital to add them after the cereal as they help bind all the ingredients nicely together.

After adding the rest of the ingredients, run the food processor for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the ingredients become clumpy, which is the desired texture. It is crucial not to overrun the food processor to keep the crunchiness of the Rice Krispies cereal. Once done, start making the balls. I scoop about 1 1/2 tbsp of the mixture, form it using my palms to make a ball, then roll it in the cooled-down roasted and desiccated coconut. Repeat the process until you are done making the balls. It should be about 27 pieces. You can now enjoy your roasted cashew balls!
