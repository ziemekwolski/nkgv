## Ingredients:
### Serving: 3 1/2 cups
* 1 tbsp coconut oil - butter flavour
* 6 large Chinese eggplant
* 1 1/2 cup chop tomato
* 1 cup chop onion
* 8 cloves finely chop garlic
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1 1/2 tsp finely chopped ginger
* 1/2 tsp caraway seeds
* 1 tsp brown cumin seeds
* 1 1/2 tsp garam masala
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp chat masala
* 1/4 cup cilantro
* Salt and pepper
* Hot chilli pepper (optional)

### Method:

Preheat the oven to 450.
Poke eggplant with knife or fork and then arrange in a baking sheet, bake for 35 mins. After 25 mins of baking, flip the eggplant, then finish baking for another 10 minutes. It is cooked when it's soft to the touch. Take the eggplant out from the oven, cool down, just enough not to burn your hand when peeling it. It is easier to peel the eggplant when it's still hot. Peel the eggplants and remove the non-edible brown top. Cut and separate it using a fork. You can also use a potato masher if you own one. 

On a stovetop, warm up a skillet, add coconut oil (butter flavour). Start frying cumin seeds and caraway seeds together. Keep mixing it while frying to avoid burning. Add onion, garlic and ginger to the mix. At this point, add the chop green hot chilli pepper if you like it spicy. Continue cooking until onions become translucent. Add eggplant, tomato, turmeric, smoked paprika and garam masala. Mix while separating any clumpy eggplant pieces, cook for 20 minutes in med-low heat temperature, mixing in between. Add salt and pepper (season according to your liking). After 20 minutes, add chat masala and cilantro and cook for another 2-5 minutes. Voila!
