Vegan taco? No problem. Even tastier than the meat ones that I used to eat before I became vegan. Delicious, crunchy, and satisfying. The mushroom gives that meaty taste along with the texture of chop walnuts. Add it with your favourite spices, and trust me, tacos are the perfect way to go!  They are very satisfying and filling and are sure to delight almost anyone. Now, enough with the yapping, and let's get to it!

## Ingredients:

### Vegan Meat
* 1 tbsp grapeseed oil
* 4 cups finely chop mushroom
* 2 cups finely chop walnuts
* 1/2 of big onion chop
* 4 cloves chop garlic
* 2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme
* 1 cup of water
* 1 Tbsp. Tomato paste
* 1 tsp caraway seeds, ground
* 2 tsp. Smoked paprika
* 1 1/2 tbsp. Soya sauce
* 1 tbsp. Nutritional yeast
* 1 tbsp. Lime juice
* 1/4 cup chop parsley

### Toppings
* 1/2 of avocado (cubed)
* 1/2 of big tomato
* Lettuce leaves
* Sea salt and pepper

### Sauce
* 4 tbsp. vegan mayonnaise
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard
* 2 tbsp. Ketchup
* 1 tbsp. Water

## Instructions:

__*Vegan Meat*__

Start with soaking the walnuts with hot or warm water to soften them for about 30 minutes to an hour. While waiting for the walnuts, you can chop the mushroom into small pieces and garlic and onion. You can also finely chop the parsley and prepare all the dry ingredients that you need.

Now go back to the soaked walnuts, drain them and chop them into a small coarse texture.

On a stovetop, warm the skillet to medium heat. Once hot enough, you can add the onion. Saut√© them for about a minute before adding the garlic then the thyme. Let it cook until the onion is translucent, add the chopped mushroom, and cook it for 5 minutes. Add chop walnuts, grounded caraway seeds, smoked paprika (adjust to 1 tsp if you want it less smokey), tomato paste, gluten-free soya sauce and 1 cup of water. Mix it and cook for 10 minutes. Continue mixing in between to avoid burning. After 10 mins, once the liquid has absorbed, you can add the nutritional yeast and then chopped parsley and drizzle it with lime juice. You can adjust by putting sea salt and pepper if needed. Don't forget the thyme sprig if using a fresh one.

__*The sauce*__

In a small bowl, combine vegan mayonnaise, dijon mustard, ketchup, and water to thin it out. Mix it well.

__*Putting it together*__

Now you can slice half of the avocado into small cubes and thinly chop some lettuce for your toppings.

Bake your vegan taco shells according to package instructions. I also sometimes used soft taco or a lettuce leaf.

You can now assemble your taco and serve.
