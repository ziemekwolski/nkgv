Do you need a little spice in your dish? Is it a little plain? Well, this recipe for smokey chili oil is a perfect addition. You can use it in soup, grilled sunflower heads or stir-fries dishes. It makes all your food pop with flavour!

## Ingredients:
* 1 cup avocado oil
* 1/4 cup gochujang (Korean pepper flakes)
* 1 slice ginger
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small bunch of fresh thyme
* 1 tsp tri-blend peppercorns
* 1/2 tsp caraway seeds
* 1 star anise
* 2 green cardamom pods
* 4 pcs cloves
* 1 tbsp roasted white sesame seeds
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp Himalayan salt
* 1/4 tsp black vinegar

## Method:

Turn the stovetop to medium heat and warm up a frying pan. Add peppercorns, caraway seeds, star anise, green cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf. If your white sesame seeds are not roasted, add them to the pan, but skip this process if you bought them already roasted. Roast the spice for about 1 minute or until slightly brown. Make sure to keep mixing it while roasting. When done, take it out from the stovetop cool it down while preparing the oil mixture.

Using a small pot, add the avocado oil, garlic, ginger, and thyme. As soon as the oil comes to boil or starts sizzling, turn off the oven and let the herbs cook in the oil for 15 minutes.

Using a small mason jar or a wide-mouth bottle, put the roasted spices, gochujang or Korean pepper flakes and the black vinegar. Back to the oil, remove all the solid ingredients from it by using a small strainer. Strain it into the mason jar. Mix it, then voila! Chili oil is ready to use.
Please note to keep the chili oil at room temperature.
