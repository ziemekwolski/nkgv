Nothing better than making your very own Parmesan Cheese. It's vegan, and it's the real thing. You only need four ingredients, and it takes 10 seconds to complete. Now let's get started!

## Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup cashew nuts
* 2 Tbsp. nutritional yeast
* 1 Tbsp. Roasted sesame seeds
* 1/4 tsp sea salt

## Method:

Put all ingredients in a spice grinder or food processor. Run it for 10 seconds or until you get that powdery parmesan texture, and bam, boom, done!

I told you it's quick and easy. Now enjoy your very own vegan parmesan cheese.
