In the past, I have tried many different vegan bread recipes. Many came out were not fluffy or moist enough. After many various attempts, I came across this gem. This banana bread has the perfect amount of fluff and flavour. Give it a try, and you won't regret it!


## Ingredients:

* 2 cups oat flour
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/8 tsp sea salt
* 3 overripe banana
* 3/4 cup plain vegan milk
* 3 Tbsp agave
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 3 Tbsp cacao powder
* 1/4 cup vegan chocolate chips

## Method

Preheat oven to 350F.


In a mixing bowl, put oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg and sea salt. Mix until well combined.

In a separate bowl, peel the overripe banana and mash it. It should be about 1 and 1/2 cups mashed. Add plain vegan milk to the smashed banana; I used oat milk. Finally, add agave syrup and vanilla. Mix well.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix. Divide the mixture into half in each separate bowl. In one half, add vegan chocolate chips and mix. In the other half, add cacao powder and mix until well combined.

Using a rectangular bread baking dish, oil it. Holding each hand in each separate bowl, pour the mixture simultaneously into the baking dish to evenly distribute it on each side. Using a stick or spatula, gently run it in an S motion to create the marble effect.

Bake it for 40-45 minutes. To check the doneness, poke a toothpick in the middle. If the toothpick comes out clean, then your Banana Bread is cooked. I check the doneness after 40 minutes, and if it needs more, then continue for another 5 minutes.

When cooked, remove the baking dish from the oven, place it on the counter, and cover the dish with a tea towel for 10 minutes to let it settle. After 10 minutes, you can transfer the bread to a cutting board and slice it. Enjoy!
