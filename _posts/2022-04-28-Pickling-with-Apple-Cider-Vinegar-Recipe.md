My idea of pickling daikon and red radish came when I started creating poke bowl meals for my family. Daikon and red radish are in the same family. Daikon is a winter radish and looks like a carrot which is long except it's thicker and white. The taste is sweeter and juicier. On the other hand, red radish looks like a small bulb, and it has that spicy sting to it. When pickled, it has this satisfying crunch when you bite it that makes it so addictive. The orange zest in this recipe gives a sweeter aroma to both daikon and red radish. Trust me; it is delicious and enjoyable to eat.

The measurement of this recipe is enough for a 500 ml mason jar. I sometimes double the recipe for the brine to ensure I have enough of it. One needs enough liquid to cover the vegetables. If there is leftover brine, I store it in another mason jar and put it in the fridge for my next pickling session. Just make sure to boil it again.

Alright! Let's get into the process!

## Ingredients:
* Daikon (3 1/2 inch long) or
* 7 pcs red radishes
* 6 pcs peppercorns
* Orange zest (8 thin strips)
* 1 sprigs of fresh thyme

* 1/2 cup apple cider
* 6 Tbsp cane sugar
* 1 Tbsp sea salt
* 1 cup water

## Method:

Wash and peel the daikon, and cut vertically into small strips. With the red radish, wash and pat to dry and slice it thinly. Using a knife or a peeler, peel at least a quarter of zest from a big orange and cut it vertically into tiny strips. I use about eight strips of orange zest in each jar.

Using two 500ml wide-mouth mason jars, I arrange the daikon in one jar and red radish in the other. In each jar, sparingly put 8 strips of orange zest, 6 pieces of peppercorns and 1 sprig of fresh thyme.

Consider doubling the recipe if needed to make the brine, but usually, one measurement is just enough. It would be best to have sufficient brine to cover the daikon and red radish.

![Brine](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-28-pickling-with-apple-cider-vinegar-recipe/brine.jpg "Brine")

Put cane sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, and water in a pot. Bring it to a boil for about 1 minute, constantly mixing until sugar and salt dissolve. Once finished, pour the boiling liquid mixture into the jar covering the daikon and red radish. While they are still hot, put the lid of the jar right away. Let it cool at room temperature before putting it in the fridge. Pickled daikon and red radish are ready to consume the following day. Once the jar is open, it could stay in the refrigerator for about 2 months or until you see it moldy or cloudy; use your best judgement.
