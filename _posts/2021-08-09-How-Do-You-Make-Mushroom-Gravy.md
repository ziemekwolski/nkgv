There's nothing yummier than adding that perfect mushroom gravy to your meal to get that mmm satisfaction. I usually use this for my eggplant steak, bento bowl or even just on top of brown rice or quinoa. Now let's get to that gravy!

## Ingredients:

* Grapeseed oil
* 205 grams Oyster mushroom
* 1/4 cup onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 sprig fresh thyme or 1/4 tsp dried
* 1 tsp sake or rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp coconut sugar
* 1 cup water
* Sea salt & pepper

### Method:

Slice mushroom into 4, chop onion and garlic.

Turn on the stovetop to medium and heat the pan with 1 tsp of oil. When hot, add onion and garlic thyme, saute for about 1 minute. Add mushroom, salt and pepper, then cook it for 10 minutes. Makes sure you mix it between to avoid burning the mushroom. After 10 minutes, add sake or rice vinegar, coconut sugar and water. Bring it to a boil, then cook it for 5 minutes. After five minutes, give it a taste if it needs more salt according to your liking. When done, turn off the stove and let the mushroom mixture cool down for at least 10 minutes.

When it's cooled down, transfer the mixture to the blender and run at medium to high speed. Keep it running for about 30 seconds or until you get that gravy consistency. Voila! Your gravy is now ready to serve.
