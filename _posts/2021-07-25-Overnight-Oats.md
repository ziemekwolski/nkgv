## Ingredients:

* 1/2 cup steel-cut oat
* 1 Tbsp. Coconut sugar
* 1 Tbsp. Ground chia
* 1 Tbsp. Hemp seeds
* 1 Tbsp. Ground flax seeds
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. Vanilla (optional)
* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
* 1-2 strawberries (optional)
* 3/4 cup vegan milk

Overnight oat is our top choice breakfast in the kitchen. We like it because it is high in iron and high in omega 3s. It is also easy to prepare, and you can make it ahead of time. I normally pre-prepared five days in advance or more in a set of jars, so I don't need to do the process every day. I used steel-cut oats in this recipe, but you can also use rolled oats or just the regular oat if it's not available in your kitchen. Now let's get to it.

### Method:

To prepare ahead of time, I have nine mason jars with a lid, put all the dry ingredients (the first six on the ingredient's list), close the top, and put it in my pantry. In the evening, I grab a jar or two and add vegan milk of your choice. You can also add the vanilla if you like it; I prefer without it. Mix it well with a spoon until you don't see any more dry clumps. Put the lid on and put it in the fridge for the following day.

The next day I transfer it to a pot, the mixture becomes thick, so I add at least 1/4 cup of milk. If you are using fresh blueberries, eat it as it. For frozen blueberries, I suggest warming it up for about two minutes on low-medium heat with the oats. Top it with strawberries if you like.

Another way of serving it is to eat it cold. To do that, add all the ingredients to a jar, mix it and put it in the fridge. Grab it the following day, and it's ready to eat.
