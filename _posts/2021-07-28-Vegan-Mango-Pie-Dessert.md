There's nothing quite like sitting down and enjoying a delicious sweet vegan mango dessert. This vegan mango dessert is sure to delight anyone who is looking to retreat after a long day! With no artificial sweeteners and all-natural whole food vegan ingredients, you can rest assured that this pie is a guilt-free experience.

On top of that, you don't even need to bake it!


## Ingredients:

### For the Pie Crust
* 1 1/2 cup walnuts
* 3/4 cup sunflower seeds
* 1 cup dates
* 1 Tbsp water

### For the Cream Filling
* 3/4 cup cashew (soaked)
* 1 1/2 cup blueberries
* 3 ripe champaign mango (divided)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla

### Method:

__*The Crust*__

First, prepare is the cashews. Soak it for 8 hrs or overnight. If you're in a rush, you can also soak the cashew with hot water for 3 hours. When you are ready to make the mango dessert, drain and rinse the cashew once in a strainer. Leave it draining while you start preparing the crust.

In a food processor, put walnuts, sunflower seeds, dates and process until coarsely chopped. To make it stick together, add the water and run it for at least 10 seconds. Using a 9inch round pie tray, put wax paper to the tray for lining, pour the crust mixture into it. Press the crust mixture firmly around the tray evenly until the button and sides are all covered. Cut the wax paper that is sticking on the side to make it look neat. Once finished, set it aside.

__*The Filling*__

Add the drained cashew, 1 1/2 mangos and vanilla to a blender to make the mango filling. Close the lid of the blender run it until smooth. It would help if you stopped to help the blender by pushing it with a spoon or the blender baton. Once smooth, put the cream into the bowl with the crust in it. Spread it lightly and evenly with a spatula. Once done, you can now start adding the fresh mango and blueberry topping.

During the summertime, I like to have fun with kids and decorate the pie like the sun. If you don't like the idea, arrange it on top of the filling however you like it. Once finished, cover it with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for 3 hours before serving. The leftover pie can stay in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.

Happy cooking!
