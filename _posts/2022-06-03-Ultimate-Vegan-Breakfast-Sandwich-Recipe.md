Hi Friends, I'll share one of our favourite weekend breakfast sandwich treats today. I say treat because of the bagel as we don't serve it a lot in our kitchen. You can also use sliced sourdough and spelt bread as a variation.

The amount of this recipe is more than enough for four good eaters people like us. I always have scrambled tofu and sausage left over. I like to use it for a quick lunch or dinner meal the following day. You can also use the scrambled tofu and sausage for a healthy poke bowl lunch or dinner mixed. Add in some quinoa or brown rice, fresh vegetables of your choice and some sauce or you can use the hollandaise sauce in this recipe. [Check out my poke bowl recipe.](/dinner/2022/05/12/Vegan-Poke-Bowl-with-Barbecue-Turnip.html)  The sausage I used in this recipe is Gusta, and I like the smoked spices flavour with a little spicy kick. If you don't like it spicy, then use any vegan sausage of your choice as there are lots you can find in a supermarket.

Alright! I don't want to prolong the anticipation, and let's get started.

## Ingredients:

### Hollandaise Sauce
* 1 cup veggie broth reduced to 2 Tbsp
* 1 cup plain and unsweetened vegan milk
* 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 2 Tbsp potato starch
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
* 1/4 tsp sea salt

### Scrambled Tofu and Sausage
* 454 grams firm Tofu
* 350 grams smoked spices Gusta Vegan sausage
* 1/4 tsp grounded caraway seeds
* 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
* 1/2 tsp granulated garlic powder
* 2 Tbsp chopped parsley
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Vegan bagel
* Avocado slices
* Lettuce leaves

## Method

__*Hollandaise Sauce*__

In a pot, boil 1 cup of veggie broth. Keep boiling it until the liquid is thick and reduced to about 2 tablespoons. When done, remove it from the stovetop to cool down.

In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast, 2 tablespoons of potato starch, 1/4 tsp ground turmeric, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp sea salt. Combine it well until you don't see any lump of potato starch, and it is well incorporated with the rest of the ingredients.

In a pot, pour 1 cup of vegan milk, 2 tbsp of reduced veggie broth. Add the nutritional yeast dry mixture to the milk mixture gradually while mixing to avoid any lumps. Heat the combined mixture on the stovetop and bring it to a gentle boil. Keep whisking until you see steam. While whisking, add the apple cider vinegar. You can adjust the stove's heat to medium but constantly watch to prevent it from boiling completely. If the mixture starts to boil, turn down the temperature to low. Keep whisking for about 5 minutes or until the liquid becomes slightly thicker. Lastly, add the lemon juice. Once you add the lemon, it will immediately make the mixture very thick. Remove it from the stovetop immediately and transfer it to a tight lid mason jar container.

You will gain about 1 cup of sauce. Keep any leftovers in the fridge. Once you store it in the refrigerator, the mixture will become even thicker like jello. Just add a little water and mix it with a spoon to loosen it up before serving the following day.

__*The Sausage and Tofu filling*__

Remove the sausage lining, if there is one and crumble it. Do the same thing with the tofu. Remove the tofu from the package, rinse and pat it with a paper towel to dry before crumbling it in a separate bowl from the sausage.
Using a pan, cook the crumbled sausage on a stovetop to medium heat for about 4-5 minutes, mixing in between. If using an already seasoned sausage, you don't need to season it, but if you're using an unseasoned sausage, you can add salt, pepper, ground caraway and smoked paprika to give a smokey flavour to it. When done, transfer it to a bowl.

Using the same pan at the same temperature, cook the crumbled tofu. Keep cooking and mixing in between until the liquid has evaporated. Once that happens, add 1/4 tsp ground caraway seeds, 1/2  tsp turmeric powder 1/2 tsp granulated garlic, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast. Lastly, add salt and pepper to your liking and 2 tbsp chopped parsley. Mix for about 30 seconds to get the parsley slightly wilted and incorporated into the tofu mixture. Remove from the stovetop and transfer it to a bowl.

__*Putting it all together*__

Rinse and clean a few leaves of fresh lettuce. Slice some avocado and Toast a bagel.

Now you can start layering your delicious and mouthwatering breakfast sandwich.

You can layer it however you prefer, but here is how I do it. I start with toasting the vegan bagel. Using the bottom part toast bagel, I put a bed of that lush green lettuce leaves, followed by a bed of sliced ripe avocado. Add about 1/4 cup of scrambled tofu and 1/4 cup of scrambled sausage. Last but not least, drizzle the hollandaise sauce on top before covering it with the top half of the toasted bagel. You can secure your sandwich with a pick. You are now ready to devour that mouthwatering breakfast sandwich.
