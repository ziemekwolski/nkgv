If you're looking for a quick, easy and healthy snack? I got you covered. This snack is nut-free, and you only need two ingredients. This is our newfound favourite, and if you have kids, this will go easy. Our top 1 out of three is the Date with chocolate spread because it reminds us of Nutella, except it's way healthier and has no preservative added.
Let's get the spreading goodness going.


## Date with Chocolate Spread

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup dried dates (approximately ten big dates)
* 2 tbsp cacao powder
* 3 tbsp date water (from the water that you soak the date with)

### Method:

First, you soak the dried dates with hot water for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of soaking, before draining the dates. Save 3 tbsp of date water from the water you use to soak the dried dates with.

In a high-speed blender, put the drained and soaked dates, cacao powder and the date water and run the blender until the texture is smooth. I help the blending process with a blender baton if you have one or a spatula blending until you get the smooth consistency you want to achieve. This process takes me about 1-2 minutes. Now you can transfer the spread into a tight lid container, but before you tuck it away in the fridge, don’t hold yourself to enjoy the spread.

You can put it in bread, pancake and give some extra sweetness kick to your morning breakfast muffin.

## Date with Cherry Spread

### Ingredients:

* 1 cup dried dates
* 1 cup frozen cherries or fresh if available

### Method:

First, you soak the dried dates with hot water for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of soaking, before draining the dates.

While the date is soaking, put 1 cup of frozen cherries or fresh cherries in a small pot if available. Add 1 cup water or enough to cover the cherries. On a stovetop, bring the cherries to boil. When boil, reduce the temperature to below medium heat. Cook it for approximately 30 minutes or until the cherries are caramelized. Remove from the stovetop to cool down.

Once cool down, put the cherries and the drained soak dates in the blender. Run it until smooth and voila! Your Date with Cherry spread is now ready to enjoy!


## Date with Mango Spread

### Ingredients:

* 1 cup dried dates
* 1 cup dried mango

### Method:

First, you soak the dried dates and mango with hot water for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of soaking, before draining the dates.

After 30 minutes of soaking, drain it and put it in the blender. Blend until smooth, and just like that, you got yourself a Date with Mango Spread!
