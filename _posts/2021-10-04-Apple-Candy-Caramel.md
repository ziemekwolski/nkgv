This apple caramel is the healthier version of that super sugary apple candy you get in some stores. The sweetness is just enough using pitted dates. The bonus part? It is so easy to make.

I created it nut-free, mainly for my kids to bring it to school since they cannot bring any peanuts at school if we eat it at home though we love to sprinkle it with crush roasted peanut to have that extra crunchy bite to it.
Now enough with the talking, and let's get to the process.

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup pitted dates
* 1/3 cup coconut cream
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2-3 apples
* 1/4 cup roasted nuts (optional)

## Method:

Soak pitted dates in hot water for about 30 minutes to an hour. After it's been soak and soft, drain it and put it in the blender together with coconut cream, sea salt and vanilla. Run it medium to high speed until you get that smooth caramel texture. Transfer to a bowl.
I usually dip a whole apple, quarter, or even small bite sizes of apple in a bowl, and my kids dip it into the caramel as they eat.
You can now enjoy your caramel with a fruit of your choice.
